# PokeGAN
My attempt to use a GAN to generate Pok√©mon sprites.

This repo contains several different architectures that I used to experiment on making the GAN. 

[PokeGAN.py](./PokeGAN.py) was my intial attempt using a fully connected neural network. As this project is trying to generate images, this approach didn't work well.
